/**
 * The main activity class of the NumberGuess game app. 
 * Extends from the 
 * [android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity]
 * class and is thus compatible with earlier 
 * Android versions.
 *
 * The app shows a GUI with the following buttons:
 * - **Start**: Starts the game
 * - **Do Guess**: Used for guessing a number
 *
 * Once started, the game secretly determines a random 
 * number the user has to guess. The user performs 
 * guesses and gets told if the guessed number is too 
 * low, too high, or a hit.
 *
 * Once hit, the game is over.
 *
